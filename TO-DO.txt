1. For "Project entry page" implement drop-down response entries with the information from the databases of  each part for each part required.
when  we ask for a CPU, there should be a drop down with all the names of CPUs from our database, currently 2. Intel Core i9-10900X and RYZEN 5600X.

( I found a way to do the dropdowns, what's tricky is to pupulate them with the data fromt the data base.) 


2.For "Project entry page", Implement a button to save the user data input from the project table (PC build name, Built date,Category, case, motherboard, 
CPU, CPU Cooler, Memory, Main storage, Power Supply, GPU. ) & save it to the table "projects" in the database. 

3. For "Previous Project Page", Implement a button or a way to erase each 'project' entry from
the database. to demostrate data deletion from database. 

4.For "Previous Project Page", Implement a button to go to "Project entry page" to create a new page.

5.If there's time, Create a new page to display all the details of a specific project. A more detailed view.
currently,in Previous projects we just show the most basic details, we could display all the info of each part
if requiered by an user. 

6.- polish the webpage, make it look better.
